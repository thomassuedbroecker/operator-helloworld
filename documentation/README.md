# Operator Framework Ansible Workshop

### Introduction

In this workshop you will automate the deployment of an `Hello World!` application to OpenShift, with an `Hello World` operator.

The automation of your simple operator will do for you:

* the deployment of the application 
    * Create deployment
    * Create service
    * Create route
        * Therefor we will collect application domain information

Your operator will have capability **Level 1** as you see in the image below.

_Note:_ The image resource you can find on the [Operator Framework: What?](https://operatorframework.io/what/) page.
