# Operator Framework and Ansible hands-workshop

### Introduction

In this workshop you will automate the deployment of an `Hello World!` application to OpenShift, with an `Hello World` operator, implemented with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

Your first simple operator will do for you the automates of the creation of :

  * a deployment
  * a service
  * a route
    * Therefor it needs to collect the application domain information

Your operator will have some of the capabilities in **Level 1** as you see in the image below.

_Note:_ The image resource you can find on the [Operator Framework: What?](https://operatorframework.io/what/) page.

This is the definition for Level 1 from the [Operator Framework](https://operatorframework.io/operator-capabilities/)

>Features
>
>Installation Of The Workload
>
>* Operator deploys an Operand or configures off-cluster resources
>
>* Operator waits for managed resources to reach a healthy state
>
>* Operator conveys readiness of application or managed resources to the user leveraging the status block of the Custom Resource

>Configuration Of The Workload
>
>* Operator provides configuration via the spec section of the Custom Resource
>
>* Operator reconciles configuration and updates to it with the status of the managed resources

### Objectives

This workshop will show you how to setup a development environment and deploy your first Operator written in Ansible. 

Upon completing this workshop you will learn the following:

* Setup Ansible Operator Development Environment
* Create Operator Scaffolding and [Custom Resource Definition (CRD/RD)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/rest_api/extension_apis/customresourcedefinition-apiextensions-k8s-io-v1.html)
* Test and Debug Operators
* Read parameter inputs from [Custom Resource Definition (CRD/RD)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/rest_api/extension_apis/customresourcedefinition-apiextensions-k8s-io-v1.html) into [Ansible facts](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html)
* Read and create k8s objects using the [k8s Ansible Module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/kubernetes/k8s_info_module.html)
* Deploy Application
