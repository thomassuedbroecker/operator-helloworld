# Install Operator Framework SDK

This workshop requires minimum v1.0.1 of the [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and [ansible-operator](https://www.ansible.com/integrations/containers/operators) binaries.

[Download](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases) a pre-built release of both binaries and install them under /usr/bin.

> _Note:_ If you use [brew](https://brew.sh) on Ubuntu for the operator framework installation, it also worked for me :-).
