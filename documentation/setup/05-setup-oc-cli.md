# Install OpenShift Command Line Tools

The OpenShift command line tools ships with oc and kubectl binaries.

[Download](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) a pre-built release and install the oc as well as kubectl binaries under /usr/bin. You will need to login with your Red Hat account and select the infrastructure provider where your OpenShift cluster is running. Remember to check the permissions and ensure the binaries have execute permission. You can also download command line tools for OpenShift from the OpenShift cluster itself under the question mark by your user in the UI.
